## Content Principles

### 1. Be Human, Not Corporate

**Do**: "Let's find the perfect match for your style"
**Don't**: "Our extensive inventory offers numerous options"

**Do**: "Oops, something went wrong. Let's try that again."
**Don't**: "Error 404: Resource not found"

### 2. Show, Don't Just Tell

**Do**: "See how the light dances across the marble's surface in our showroom"
**Don't**: "High-quality marble available"

**Do**: "Your designer will create 3D renderings during your consultation—see your new space before we begin"
**Don't**: "3D design services available"

### 3. Make It About Them

**Do**: "Your kitchen, your way, in just 3 weeks"
**Don't**: "We offer 3-week installation"

**Do**: "Choose from hundreds of slabs to match your vision"
**Don't**: "Large inventory in stock"

### 4. Simplify Without Dumbing Down

**Do**: "Quartz resists stains and scratches—perfect for busy families"
**Don't**: "Quartz is good" OR "Engineered quartz features a non-porous surface with superior resistance to chemical etching"

### 5. Guide, Don't Push

**Do**: "When you're ready, we're here to help"
**Don't**: "Buy now!" or "Limited time offer!"

**Do**: "Most of our clients find it helpful to visit the showroom"
**Don't**: "You must visit our showroom"
